# TrafficFlow
Problem Statement:
Commuters frequently experience delays due to unexpected traffic incidents, leading to frustration and lost time. While current traffic management systems provide real-time updates, they often lack predictive capabilities that could help prevent or mitigate delays.

Objective:
Develop an AI-driven platform that analyzes real-time traffic data, weather conditions, and historical incident patterns to predict potential traffic disruptions. The system should provide early warnings to users and suggest alternative routes, helping commuters avoid delays and reducing overall traffic congestion.
